## About Me

I am a Senior Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating innovative, efficient, and scalable web solutions. My journey began with JavaScript, which ignited my curiosity and laid the foundation for my career. I have developed robust applications using Node.js and modern frontend technologies like React, Remix, Redux, and Next.js. Over the years, I’ve built projects such as an Elementor clone and a dynamic photo editor, and I have created more than 200 APIs using both Node.js and Python frameworks like FastAPI and Flask. My work is driven by a commitment to clean code, responsive design, and continuous learning—currently exploring Rust, Java, and mobile development with React Native. I also bring a solid understanding of DevOps practices, ensuring my projects are secure, performant, and scalable.
