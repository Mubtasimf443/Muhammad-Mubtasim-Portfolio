Look, because of AI, 70 million jobs will be destroyed. What will these 70 million people do?

Among them, 0.1%—those with 200 IQs—might become entrepreneurs. If 10,000 people who lost their jobs to AI decide to start their own ventures, and they have 200 IQs, I can’t even imagine what might happen.

In every tech company, there are certain individuals who are the root cause of its success. If they lose their jobs, new tech companies will emerge. The number of new companies could grow so large that even established founders like Sam Altman might lose their dominance, and we could see hundreds of OpenAI-like competitors.

Historically, there was an era when a king’s son would inherit the throne. AI is going to disrupt that paradigm.

AI cannot truly replace humans. In the future, we might enter an era of ‘superhumans.’

Some founders are building AI to replace jobs, but those displaced by AI could one day replace those very AI companies by creating their own.

These are my thoughts.
